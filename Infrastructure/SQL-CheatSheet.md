# SQL 语法速览与备忘清单

SQL 是 Structrued Query Language 的缩写，即结构化查询语言。它是负责与 ANSI(美国国家标准学会)维护的数据库交互的标准。作为关系数据库的标准语言，它已被众多商用 DBMS 产品所采用，使得它已成为关系数据库领域中一个主流语言，不仅包含数据查询功能，还包括插入、删除、更新和数据定义功能。最为重要的 SQL92 版本的详细标准可以查看[这里](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt)，或者在 [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) 上查看 SQL 标准的变化。

```sql
-- Comments start with two hyphens. End each command with a semicolon.

-- SQL is not case-sensitive about keywords. The sample commands here
-- follow the convention of spelling them in upper-case because it makes
-- it easier to distinguish them from database, table, and column names.

-- Create and delete a database. Database and table names are case-sensitive.
CREATE DATABASE someDatabase;
DROP DATABASE someDatabase;

-- List available databases.
SHOW DATABASES;

-- Use a particular existing database.
USE employees;

-- Select all rows and columns from the current database's departments table.
-- Default activity is for the interpreter to scroll the results on your screen.
SELECT * FROM departments;

-- Retrieve all rows from the departments table,
-- but only the dept_no and dept_name columns.
-- Splitting up commands across lines is OK.
SELECT dept_no,
       dept_name FROM departments;

-- Retrieve all departments columns, but just 5 rows.
SELECT * FROM departments LIMIT 5;

-- Retrieve dept_name column values from the departments
-- table where the dept_name value has the substring 'en'.
SELECT dept_name FROM departments WHERE dept_name LIKE '%en%';

-- Retrieve all columns from the departments table where the dept_name
-- column starts with an 'S' and has exactly 4 characters after it.
SELECT * FROM departments WHERE dept_name LIKE 'S____';

-- Select title values from the titles table but don't show duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT title FROM titles;

-- Same as above, but sorted (case-sensitive) by the title values.
SELECT DISTINCT title FROM titles ORDER BY title;

-- Show the number of rows in the departments table.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM departments;

-- Show the number of rows in the departments table that
-- have 'en' as a substring of the dept_name value.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM departments WHERE dept_name LIKE '%en%';

-- A JOIN of information from multiple tables: the titles table shows
-- who had what job titles, by their employee numbers, from what
-- date to what date. Retrieve this information, but instead of the
-- employee number, use the employee number as a cross-reference to
-- the employees table to get each employee's first and last name
-- instead. (And only get 10 rows.)

SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name,
       titles.title, titles.from_date, titles.to_date
FROM titles INNER JOIN employees ON
       employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no LIMIT 10;

-- List all the tables in all the databases. Implementations typically provide
-- their own shortcut command to do this with the database currently in use.
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_TYPE='BASE TABLE';

-- Sub Query
SELECT DISTINCT course_id
    FROM section
    WHERE semester = ‘Fall’ AND year= 2009 AND course_id IN (
        SELECT course_id
            FROM section
            WHERE semester = ‘Spring’ AND year= 2010
    );

-- Create a table called tablename1, with the two columns shown, for
-- the database currently in use. Lots of other options are available
-- for how you specify the columns, such as their datatypes.

/**
CREATE TABLE <table_name1> (
    <col_name1> <col_type1>,
    <col_name2> <col_type2>,
    <col_name3> <col_type3>
    PRIMARY KEY (<col_name1>),
    FOREIGN KEY (<col_name2>) REFERENCES <table_name2>(<col_name2>)
);
**/
CREATE TABLE tablename1 (fname VARCHAR(20), lname VARCHAR(20));

-- Insert a row of data into the table tablename1. This assumes that the
-- table has been defined to accept these values as appropriate for it.
INSERT INTO tablename1 VALUES('Richard','Mutt');

-- In tablename1, change the fname value to 'John'
-- for all rows that have an lname value of 'Mutt'.
UPDATE tablename1 SET fname='John' WHERE lname='Mutt';

-- Delete rows from the tablename1 table
-- where the lname value begins with 'M'.
DELETE FROM tablename1 WHERE lname like 'M%';

-- Delete all rows from the tablename1 table, leaving the empty table.
DELETE FROM tablename1;

-- Remove the entire tablename1 table.
DROP TABLE tablename1;
```
